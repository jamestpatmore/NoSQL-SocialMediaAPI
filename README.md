## Description 
:old_key::old_key::old_key:
This is a backend Social Media application using MongoDB. With it being a backend application, Insomnia is a great tool to test the routes as well and work around the application to test it's capibilites..

First off we have :
Users :lotus_position:
Friends :couple_with_heart_woman_man:
Thoughts :open_book:
Reactions :bookmark:

Just like any social media application these all work cohesivley with the user. 

## Usage 

I have a walkthrough video that talks about all of the functionalities with this application [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e6GwW9yHHUw2NpeWjydiLw7KhEPARLV7/view)

Or you can clone the repo and start the server using 

```md
npm i
```
to make sure you have all those dependencies installed 

then..
```md
npm run dev
```

then you will run this local host server on insomnia and use the routes that are within the file to play around with the application 


## User Story 

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria 

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
